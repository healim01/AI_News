The article is about the growing trend of "deepfake" technology being used to create fake videos and images, often for malicious purposes. 
Deepfakes are created using artificial intelligence algorithms to manipulate images and videos, allowing people to create incredibly realistic forgeries.
The article highlights how deepfakes are becoming more accessible and easier to create, and are being used for a variety of nefarious purposes, including political propaganda, revenge porn, and fraud. 
It also notes that as the technology improves, it may become even harder to distinguish between real and fake videos and images.
The article discusses efforts to combat the spread of deepfakes, including the use of machine learning algorithms to detect fakes, and the development of blockchain-based systems to verify the authenticity of digital media. 
However, it also notes that these efforts may not be enough to stop the spread of deepfakes, and that more needs to be done to raise awareness of the issue and educate people on how to spot fake videos and images.
